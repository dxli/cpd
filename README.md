All the code related to Common Print Dialog project of GSoC '17

## Intro
I am participating in the Google Summer of Code 2017 working for the OpenPrinting division of The Linux Foundation. The goal of the project is to build a Print Dialog in Qt in order to make the process of printing simple and uniform across multiple platforms and devices. The project idea can be found here: https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2017-openprinting-projects I am one of the two students working on the dialog itself while there are other students working on different backend APIs(CUPS, IPP, Google Cloud print etc.). 

Please note that the documentation (including License information) for this section of the project will be added during the last phase of GSoC i.e. around the first week of August, 2017 and this is NOT the official repository of the project.
